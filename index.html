			<h3>My Road to Software Engineer</h3>
			<p>Hi! I'm Sherry Bai, an aspiring full-time Python developer. My journey began in the bustling world of Wall Street as a financial analyst. It was an interesting start, but I often found myself caught up in repetitive tasks.</p>
			<p>Then there comes the magic day when I wrote my first VB program in an Excel spreadsheet in 2016, which saved me an hour daily. I felt like a magician, unlocking a new realm of possibilities.</p>
			<p>Driven by this revelation, I immersed myself in the world of Python and SQL, focusing on streamlining workflows and enhancing data analysis processes. My efforts soon led me to a rewarding role as a data analyst in 2018. Over the next five years, I ascended through the ranks to become the lead data analyst for Arknights, a game with a global user base of 10 billion. In addition, I devoted my spare time to developing websites, web crawlers, and indie games.</p>
			<p>This year marks a pivotal transition for me as I venture into full-time Python development. I'm currently seeking new opportunities and am eager to connect with like-minded professionals and potential employers. Feel free to reach out to me at sherrybaibai@163.com!</p>

			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <a href="/pages/resources/" title="A listing of CSS-related resources"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
			<p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
			<p>Download the sample <a href="/examples/index" title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified.">HTML</a> and <a href="/examples/style.css" title="This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify.">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don&#8217;t submit half-finished work) upload your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server under your control. <a href="/pages/submit/" title="Use the contact form to send us your CSS file">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>

			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>

			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The sherry-body is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
			<p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
			<p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
			<p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="/pages/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
